Hi there! I'm a M.S. student in the [Perception and Robotics Group](http://prg.cs.umd.edu/) (PRG) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/) (UMD), advised by [Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos](http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~yiannis/) and [Dr. Cornelia Fermuller](http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~fer/). My current research interests in Simultaneously Localization and Mapping, Visual Odometry, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning.

Prior to studying at UMD, I received my B.Sc. in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/en/) at [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html) in 2014. I worked with [Prof. Shao-Yi Chien](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile?id=101) in multimedia signal processing.

Nowadays the dynamic range of displays has been higher and higher, which means that contents can be recorded and displayed with more detail. However, the original low dynamic range contents were recorded in a lower dynamic range. Such contents will be unsatisfying compared to high dynamic range contents, especially in the saturated, or overexposed region. This paper proposes an algorithm to compensate such exposed regions, which is called automatic high dynamic range image hallucination for inverse tone mapping.
